This is a test document for the AgentFlow knowledge management system.

The AgentFlow platform is a comprehensive no-code/low-code Agent Builder platform that enables users to create, manage, and orchestrate multi-agent AI workflows. 

Key features include:
- Visual workflow builder interface
- Real-time monitoring and execution tracking
- Tool integrations with Notion, Slack, and custom APIs
- Text-to-agent generation capabilities
- Template marketplace for quick instantiation
- MCP protocol integration for external tool connectivity
- Advanced capabilities including frontend generation, knowledge management, data fabric integration
- Autonomous triggers and multi-agent orchestration

The platform uses LangGraph as the execution spine to provide real functionality rather than just UI demonstrations. This enables sophisticated agent workflows with full traceability and observability.

Knowledge management features include:
- Document upload and processing
- Vector embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Semantic search capabilities for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Chunking strategy with configurable overlap for optimal retrieval
- Multi-format support including text files, URLs, and structured data

The system architecture consists of:
- React frontend with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- Express.js backend with TypeScript using ES modules
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Real-time communication via WebSocket for execution monitoring
- Authentication system supporting both Auth0 and dummy authentication for development
